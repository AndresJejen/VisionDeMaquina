# PNEUMONIA R-X Classfier

This is a R-X classfier that uses convolucional Neural Networks.
We have tested 3 different ways to apply it. and we take the best model. if you like it, you can copy an improve it.

## Data
We are working on this dataset   
https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia   
A R-X images taken to pacients with normal and Pneumonia.

## Libraries

We are working with
- Tensorflow 2.0 using Keras as API.
- Matplotlib as plotting library
- pathlib as path routes from directory
- cv2 as resize and transformer between color spaces.
